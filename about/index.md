### The early days

My contact with technology begun in 1988/1989 when I did my first IPD(Data Processing Introduction) and MS-DOS training. On those days, computers were like from another planet. They were very expensive. Each computer had a price of a popular car. I also made DBASE3 and Lotus 123 trainings that year. So in 1994 my father and mother gave me an unforgettable birthday gift: It was a 486 Cytrix dx2 66Mhz with 8MB of ram and 100MB Hard Disk .

### The Linux days

In 1995 a new ISP (Internet Service Provider) called [Genetic](http://www.genetic.com.br/) was founded in my town. They’re using [Slackware](http://www.slackware.com/) Linux. That year I had my first contact with the Internet. When everyone was installing Win95, I was installing my Linux Slackware copy… The motivation was people saying: “Wow! Linux, that’s a Hacker SO!” (laughs). In 1996 I started at university and also started to work in [Genetic](http://www.genetic.com.br/). There I had a great teacher, [Flavio de Sousa](http://flaviodesousa.com/) who is an amazing mind and an incomparable geek :)

### The enterprise days
From 2001 to 2004 I worked at [Lab. Neo Química](http://www.neoquimica.com.br/) as System Analyst (started as Support Analyst) and participated on Fox Project. A SAP R/3 installation project including modules: MM(Materials Management), FI(Financial), CO(Controlling), QM(Quality Management), PP(Production Planning), SD(Sales and Distribution) and WM(Warehouse Management). I was QM and PP Key-User.

After I finished my Lato Sensu post-graduation in 2004, I moved to [Brasilia](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Brasília+-+Federal+District,+Brazil/) to  work until May 2007 in Politec allocated in [Brazilian Ministry of Justice](http://www.justica.gov.br/) where I participated in many projects that uses Java from Persistence Engine, passing by Business Component, and finally in view (Web or Desktop).
I worked for [Summa Technologies](http://www.summa-tech.com/) and [INEP](http://www.inep.gov.br/) developing system with 20.000 simultaneous users.

In november of 2009 I joinned [Red Hat](http://www.redhat.com/en) as JBoss Consultant. In 2012 I moved to Software Engineer working hard to promote enterprise Java solutions in an effective way. Since 2016 I become a Senior Product Manager, having the mission push even further the tools and practices that help developers to be more productive.

My actual interests are:

- Object Oriented / Functional Programming
- Javascript (AngularJS and NodeJS)
- Productive and Scalable Solutions
- Containers (Docker, Kubernetes and Openshift) 
- DevOps tools and practices
- Microservices
- Agile Methodologies

That’s all.

Thank you for reading. And I hope to see you again.
